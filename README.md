# Netflix - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using Python

## Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Netflix dataset that contains a list of TV shows and movies available on Netflix up to the year 2021. The analysis aims to extract insights and visualize key trends in the dataset.

## Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name**: Netflix Titles Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle / CSV File
- **Content**: The dataset includes details of TV shows and movies such as title, director, cast, release year, rating, duration, and country of origin.

## Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to analyze and visualize trends in Netflix content, including:
- Identifying missing and duplicate data
- Understanding content distribution by type, release year, director, country, and rating
- Extracting key insights using data visualizations

## Tasks and Analysis
### **Task 1: Handling Duplicate Data**
- Check for duplicate records in the dataset.
- Remove duplicate records permanently and display the cleaned dataset.

### **Task 2: Handling Missing Values**
- Identify and display null values in the dataset.
- Show the count of missing values in each column.
- Create a heatmap to visualize missing data.

### **Task 3: Specific Data Queries**
- Find the Show ID and Director name for "House of Cards".

### **Task 4: Content Release Year Analysis**
- Identify the year with the highest number of TV shows and movies released.
- Show the count of individual releases.
- Visualize the results using a bar graph.

### **Task 5: Content Type Distribution**
- Count the number of movies and TV shows.
- Visualize the count using a count plot.

### **Task 6: Specific Content Filtering**
- Display movies released in the year 2000.
- Show the titles of TV shows released only in India.
- List the top 10 directors who contributed the most content to Netflix.
- Retrieve all records where (Category is "Movie" and Type is "Comedies") OR Country is "United Kingdom".
- Count and display the movies/TV shows featuring Tom Cruise.

### **Task 7: Rating Analysis**
- Identify all ratings defined by Netflix.
- Show the distribution of content ratings in a graph.
- Count the number of unique ratings.
- Find how many movies have a "TV-14" rating in Canada.
- Count how many TV shows got an "R" rating after 2018.

### **Task 8: Duration Analysis**
- Identify the maximum and minimum duration of a movie/TV show on Netflix.

### **Task 9: Country-wise Analysis**
- Find the country with the highest number of TV shows.
- Visualize the count of TV shows for each country in a graph.
- Compare the count of movies and TV shows for each country using a graph.

### **Task 10: Sorting and Trends Over Time**
- Sort the dataset by year of release.
- Display the count of movies and TV shows released in each year using a line chart.
- Identify the top 5 directors based on the number of movies/TV shows they directed.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Visualization Techniques Used
- Heatmaps for missing values
- Bar graphs for content distribution by year
- Count plots for content type distribution
- Line charts for trend analysis
- Pie charts and comparative bar charts for country-wise content distribution

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into Netflix's content catalog by leveraging data analysis techniques. Key findings include trends in content production, popular directors, and rating distributions, along with a breakdown of missing and duplicate records.
