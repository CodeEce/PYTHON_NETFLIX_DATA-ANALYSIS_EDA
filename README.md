*Project Title:* Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using Python


*Objective:*
The primary objective of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset to uncover insights about the content available on the platform. This analysis will help understand patterns and trends related to movies and TV shows, including their genres, release years, ratings, and more.

*Dataset:*
The dataset contains information about various movies and TV shows  along with the actor, genre,director details, country released and duration available on Netflix

*Scope of Work:*
1. *Data Cleaning:*
   - Handle missing values.
   - Correct any data inconsistencies.
   - Convert data types where necessary (e.g., dates, durations).

2. *Data Exploration:*
   - Distribution of movies and TV shows.
   - Trend of content added over the years.
   - Most common genres and their distribution.
   - Analysis of content by country.
   - Analysis of content ratings.
   - Duration analysis for movies and TV shows.
   - Identify top directors and actors based on the dataset.

3. *Visualization:*
   - Use visualizations to represent the findings.
   - Generate plots such as histograms, bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots to illustrate key insights.
